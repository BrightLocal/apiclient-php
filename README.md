BrightLocal API
===============

A basic PHP wrapper to make using the BrightLocal API a little easier. It takes care of authentication so you just need to specify which method you want to call and pass parameters.

Installation
------------

It's easiest to install and use the library via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer require brightlocal/apiclient-php
```
